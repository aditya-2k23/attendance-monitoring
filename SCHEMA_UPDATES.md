# Database Schema Updates - Summary

## Changes Made to Match Your Database Schema

### 1. **AuthContext.tsx**

- **Fixed student userId**: Removed reference to non-existent `roll_no` field
- **Used database ID**: Now uses `studentData.id?.toString()` as userId for students since there's no roll_no field

### 2. **AddUser.tsx Component**

- **Added phone field**: New input field for phone number (optional)
- **Added enrollment_year**: For students, includes enrollment year input
- **Conditional teacher_code**: Teacher code is now only required and shown for teachers
- **Removed roll_no**: No longer tries to save roll_no for students
- **Added is_active**: Sets `is_active: true` by default for new users
- **Updated validation**: Teacher code is only required for teachers, not for students

### 3. **Admin Dashboard**

- **Fixed user mapping**: Updated to use correct field names from your schema
- **Added is_active status**: Now properly maps the `is_active` field to user status

### 4. **Updated Form Fields**

#### For Students

- Full Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Phone (optional)
- Department (required)
- Enrollment Year (required, defaults to current year)
- Photo (optional)

#### For Teachers

- Full Name (required)
- Email (required)  
- Phone (optional)
- Teacher Code (required)
- Department (required)
- Photo (optional)

### 5. **Database Schema Match**

Your actual schema:

**Students Table:**

```plaintext
- id (primary key)
- auth_user_id (UUID)
- full_name (text)
- email (text)
- phone (text)
- department (text)
- enrollment_year (int2)
- photo_url (text)
- is_active (bool)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- updated_at (timestamptz)
```

**Teachers Table:**

```plaintext
- id (primary key)
- auth_user_id (UUID)
- teacher_code (text, unique)
- full_name (text)
- email (text)
- phone (text)
- department (text)
- photo_url (text)
- is_active (bool)
- created_at (timestamptz)
- updated_at (timestamptz)
```

## Key Differences from Previous Implementation

1. **No roll_no field** - Students don't have a student ID field in your schema
2. **Phone field added** - Both students and teachers have phone numbers
3. **enrollment_year** - Students have an enrollment year field
4. **is_active status** - Both tables have an active/inactive status
5. **updated_at timestamps** - Your schema includes update timestamps

## How the Updated System Works

### Student Creation

1. Admin fills: name, email, phone, department, enrollment year
2. System creates auth user with temporary password
3. System inserts record in students table (no student ID needed)
4. Student can login with email/password

### Teacher Creation

1. Admin fills: name, email, phone, teacher code, department  
2. System creates auth user with temporary password
3. System inserts record in teachers table with teacher_code
4. Teacher can login with email/password

### User Identification

- **Students**: Identified by database ID (auto-increment)
- **Teachers**: Identified by teacher_code (manually entered)
- **Both**: Can login using email address

## Benefits of This Update

1. **Schema Compliance**: Code now matches your exact database structure
2. **Proper Validation**: Teacher code only required for teachers
3. **Better UX**: Different forms for students vs teachers
4. **Data Integrity**: Uses actual database constraints and fields
5. **Flexible Design**: Phone numbers and enrollment years properly handled

The system is now fully compatible with your database schema and will work correctly with your Supabase setup!
